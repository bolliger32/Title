<div>For steps one and two, each of the 121 raw raster images (39 snapshots of snow depth at 3m, 39 snapshots of snow depth at 50m, 39 snapshots of SWE at 50m, and 4 snowoff rasters) was given assigned to a batch job in which it was first cropped and corrected and then resampled to 3 lower resolutions. 3m snowon data (snow depth and SWE) were resampled to 10, 30, and 50m. 50m snowon data was resampled to 100, 300, and 500m. 50m data was thus obtained both via raw rasters and via resampled 3m rasters to facilitate validation of our resampling techniques. In the case of snowoff rasters, since these were only provided at 3m, they were resampled to 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, and 500m. Node memory constraints on the HPC system we used&nbsp;</div>
