<div>Instead of just minimizing the vector u = y-Xβ, we try to filter out the autocorrelation by letting u = ⍴Wu + ε, where ⍴ is a scalar, W is a weight matrix representing the spatial autocorrelation in the dataset, and ε represents the residuals. SER minimizes the autocorrelation of the final residuals.</div>
