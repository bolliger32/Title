We use four raw "snowoff" rasters (Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{998564}</span>), which we assume are static over time. This set consists of a digital elevation map (DEM) and maps of vegetation height, canopy density (percent of a pixel covered by canopy), and land surface class (rock/soil, vegetation, water, or glacier). In addition, we use 44 "snowon" snapshots of snow depth and SWE, and a shapefile describing the basin boundaries. Both the snowoff and snowon rasters are derived from raw LiDAR point clouds but are processed by the ASO team into gridded products before we analyze them. For a detailed description of this process, see <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Painter_2016}</cite>. Snow depth grids are provided at 3-meter and 50-meter resolutions, while SWE is available only at 50-meter resolution, due to the scale of the underlying snow density model  used to produce these datasets.</div><div></div>
