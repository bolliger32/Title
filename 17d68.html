We use four raw "snowoff" rasters, which we assume are static over time. This set consists of a digital elevation map (DEM) and maps of vegetation height, canopy density (percent of a pixel covered by canopy), and land surface class (rock/soil, vegetation, water, or glacier). In addition, we use 44 "snowon" snapshots of snow depth and SWE, and a shapefile describing the basin boundaries. Both the snowoff and snowoSnow depth is provided as 3-meter and 50-meter gridded products, while SWE is available only at 50-meter resolution, due to the underlying snow density model resolution used to produce these datasets.</div><h2 data-label="725861" class="ltx_title_subsection">Data Preprocessing</h2><div>Data preprocessing consisted of several steps:</div>
