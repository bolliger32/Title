<h1 data-label="535427" class="ltx_title_section">Data and Methods</h1><div>In this section, we describe the structure of both our codebase and data, the former of which defines the high-level parallelism we exploit. We then describe methodology for data processing and for the two regression approaches we apply, each of which uses different parallelization strategies. These strategies are discussed technically in this section, while the broader challenges with and opportunities for parallelism in this project are described in the following section.</div><h2 data-label="253057" class="ltx_title_subsection">Codebase Structure - VARUN</h2><div>The codebase consists of a collection of Python scripts. Each script is responsible fora single subtask in the eventual goal of conducting regression: Preprocessing Digital Elevation Map to provide other relevant feartures, converting the GeoTIFF files into a format more efficient for use in regression, and using the reprocessed GeoTIFFs for regression.</div><h2>Data Structure</h2><div>All data for this project was obtained from  ASO  in the form of raster files in GeoTIFF format. We use four raw "snowoff" rasters (Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{998564}</span>), which we assume are static over time. This set consists of a digital elevation map (DEM) and maps of vegetation height, canopy density (percent of a pixel covered by canopy), and land surface class (rock/soil, vegetation, water, or glacier). In addition, we use 44 "snowon" snapshots of snow depth and SWE, and a shapefile describing the basin boundaries. Both the snowoff and snowon rasters are derived from raw LiDAR point clouds but are processed by the ASO team into gridded products before we analyze them. For a detailed description of this process, see <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Painter_2016}</cite>. Snow depth grids are provided at 3-meter and 50-meter resolutions, while SWE is available only at 50-meter resolution, due to the scale of the underlying snow density model  used to produce these datasets. With the exception of the land surface class raster, which was of integer, rather than single-precision float, type, each 3m raster was ~1.2 GB while each 50m raster was ~4.3 GB. The land surface class rasters were half as large.</div><div>A raw DEM provides elevation, an important feature in predicting snow depth and SWE distribution, but it also provides the basis for extracting numerous other relevant features through spatial transformations. Using a variety of existing, well-optimized algorithms provided within the GRASS GIS software, we additionally extracted the following features:</div><ul><li>Slope angle</li><li>Slope aspect (direction)</li><li>Topographic Position Index (a proxy of the convexity of the slope at a given point)</li><li>Daily Integrated Clear-sky Irradiance (estimated no-vegetation, no-clouds irradiance received by a pixel on April 1)</li><li>Standard deviation of slope in neighboring pixels (a proxy of terrain roughness)</li></ul><div></div>
