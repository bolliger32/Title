<h1 data-label="260031" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract - IAN</h1><div>Features of terrain and vegetation are often used to estimate the distribution of snow within a watershed using statistical modeling approaches <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Geddes_2005}</cite>, yet little is known of the stability/instability of these models across space, time, and model scale. This is largely due to a lack of the repeated, high-resolution measurements necessary to develop models at multiple points in time, and it inhibits the use of these statistical models in improved water resource forecasts. In this study, we use a novel dataset consisting of gridded, 3m-resolution, LiDAR-derived products depicting elevation, canopy height, canopy density, land cover classification, snow depth, and snow water equivalent (SWE) from the Tuolumne River Basin in California. Each feature is represented by a ~1 GB raster image and roughly 1,500 regressions are run to generate model parameters comparable across a variety of dimensions. Multiple levels of parallelism allow for time-efficient estimation of these models using several existing data analysis packages written in high-level languages. Results agree with previous consensus in the dominance of elevation and relative insolation as predictors of snow depth. Furthermore, we show that the importance of elevation decreases sharply moving from late winter to mid-summer, that the importance of insolation peaks in spring, and that feature importance is comparable when predicting snow depth and SWE.</div><h1 data-label="638514" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction - IAN</h1><div>Access to clean, dependable water sources is a  prerequisite for healthy societies, and one-sixth of the worldâ€™s population  depends on snowmelt for this water supply <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barnett_2005}</cite>. Efficient water use policies and  reservoir operation in snowmelt-driven regions thus depend largely on accurate  predictions of the magnitude and timing of snowmelt. These are both functions  of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), a metric combining  snow depth and density. To date, even the most advanced methods for estimating  snowmelt-driven water supply rely on sparse SWE observations and their  correlations to spring/summer streamflow. By assuming that these correlations  will stay constant into the future, we are implicitly assuming a stationary climate;  however, as climate change warms mountain regions, more winter precipitation  will fall as rain instead of snow, and snow will be confined to higher  elevations, thus altering spatial patterns and rendering these historical point observation-based correlations less useful. Since future SWE distributions may not mirror previous  patterns, there is a growing effort to better observe snow distributions and/or tmprove modeling techniqunecessitating a new approach to SWE estimation.</div><h1>Computing Resources - VARUN</h1><div></div>
