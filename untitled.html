<h1 data-label="260031" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract - IAN</h1><div>Features of terrain and vegetation are often used to estimate the distribution of snow within a watershed using statistical modeling approaches [1], yet little is known of the stability/instability of these models across space, time, and model scale. This is largely due to a lack of the repeated, high-resolution measurements necessary to develop models at multiple points in time, and it inhibits the use of these statistical models in improved water resource forecasts. In this study, we use a novel dataset consisting of gridded, 3m-resolution, LiDAR-derived products depicting elevation, canopy height, canopy density, land cover classification, snow depth, and snow water equivalent (SWE) from the Tuolumne River Basin in California. Each feature is represented by a ~1 GB raster image and roughly 1,500 regressions are run to generate model parameters comparable across a variety of dimensions. Multiple levels of parallelism allow for time-efficient estimation of these models using several existing data analysis packages written in high-level languages. Results agree with previous consensus in the dominance of elevation and relative insolation as predictors of snow depth. Furthermore, we show that the importance of elevation decreases sharply moving from late winter to mid-summer, that the importance of insolation peaks in spring, and that feature importance is comparable when predicting snow depth and SWE.</div><h1 data-label="638514" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction - IAN</h1><div></div><h1>Computing Resources - VARUN</h1><div></div>
