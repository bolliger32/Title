<h1 data-label="278131" class="ltx_title_section">Parallelism Structure and Challenges - IAN</h1><div>We exploit two levels of parallelism in this study.</div><ol><li><div>Since we are performing independent regressions on ~80 snow depth/SWE snapshots at 8 different model resolutions for 3 different regression strategies, there exists explicit embarassingly parallel parallelism.</div></li><li></li></ol><div>Using high-level data analysis languages like GRASS GIS or the scikit-learn package in Python carries the advantage of already optimized operations but also the disadvantage that these packages are often not designed for supercomputing resources and are not threadsafe. Working around the limitations represented a significant challenge of our project.</div>
