<h1 data-label="278131" class="ltx_title_section">Parallelism Structure and Challenges - CURRENTLY JUST COPIED AND PASTED FROM POSTER</h1><div>In the methods for data processing and analysis described above, we generally exploit two levels of parallelism.</div><ol><li>Since we are performing independent regressions on ~80 snow depth/SWE snapshots at 8 different model resolutions for 3 different regression strategies, there exists explicit embarassingly parallel parallelism.</li><li>Within each regression, and within data preprocessing steps, there exists both implicit and explicit parallelism opportunities. For example, we calculate daily-integrated insolation for each pixel based on the provided digital elevation map, using the GRASS GIS package. This involves calculating horizon angles along numerous azimuth angles, a computationally expensive task. These tasks are distributed and, when finished, are input to a master process that then calculates insolation.</li></ol><div>Using high-level data analysis languages like GRASS GIS or the scikit-learn package in Python carries the advantage of already optimized operations but also the disadvantage that these packages are often not designed for supercomputing resources and are not threadsafe. Working around the limitations represented a significant challenge of our project.</div><div>PUT IN SOMETHING ABOUT DIFFICULTY OF WRITING CODE THAT APPLIES TO EACH TIME POINT, RESOLUTION, DATA TYPE, ETC. GIVEN ALL OF THE SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM. ALSO, SOMETHING ABOUT RELATED DIFFICULTY OF REQUIRING EXPLICIT INPUTS AND OUTPUT STRUCTURE FOR THIS</div>
